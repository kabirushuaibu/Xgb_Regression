# Xgb_Regression

## 34 % Promotion Accuracy. (Promotion Prediction Robot for Companies).

Am Sure no company will want this robot. but why should we consider it?

Developing a machine learning models that makes predictions is not really acceptable by all especially if it has immediate impact on a Human wellbeing.  

Emotion cannot be programmed, that’s what all Bots lacks but Bots are generally trained, tested, retrained and retested until it meets our satisfaction before deployment, but even at that, human still needs to set in at some point.

Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression (Xgb Regression) is not a binary classification problem solver but more of a continues variable solver, this are number that could be two digits or have decimals, this was why it has a low performance level compared to the other Bots.

Should Bot really be used especially when we have to consider Increment, promotion, layoff or demote a staff?

Kindly check the Github for the Bot that’s able to have 34% prediction accuracy.
